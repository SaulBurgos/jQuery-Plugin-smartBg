# smartBg

This is a jquery plugin that add arrows to show the hide parts of the background. Calculate landscape and portrait position.

Is this plugin useful ? mmm maybe not, but it sounded like a great idea in my head back in time.  :)

Well .. if you want to use it here it is

Example : [http://saulburgos.com/apps/smartbg/](http://saulburgos.com/apps/smartbg/)  (click on the image to show the arrows and resize the browser if you want)
